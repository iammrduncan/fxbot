Keep in mind our conventions @../CONVENTIONS.md

Our goal is simple over complex. 
Lesser is more. 
Small over huge, light over heavy, and performance over other things.
Keep our ladder in mind of less code to do the jobs as possible. 
Keep it organized and neat.

Remember:

- first ask: is it core, or a plugin? ([Core or plugin](../CONVENTIONS.md#core-or-plugin)). A plugin phase plans the plugin, and the smallest hook it needs in the plugin API.
- reusable core bits to into packages/sdk
- specific backend for serving API goes into packages/server
- ui stuff goes into packages/ui

Phase plans should have

0. whether it is core or an add-on, and why.
1. research against references and inspiration.
2. key takeaways
3. implementation details on how to do it.
4. checklist and bounded gaols.
5. open questions to human as needed.

A user should be able to use `/goal Complete <phase-doc>.md, reread the goal before wrapping up`.
