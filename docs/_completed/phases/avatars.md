# Avatars

A bot today is a flat shape with two white eyes, and the owner's word for that is "straight up clones of grokbot". This phase gives each bot a face of its own, and makes picking one a pleasure:
- **Big, dark eyes with a glint,** the two pills from fxbot's logo, which carry every feeling.
- **Soft color,** the way plugin icons are soft, in the same eleven color names.
- **More shapes:** the fourteen a bot can have now, and eighteen more, such as toast, cat, frog, and ghost.
- **Things to wear,** on the head, the face, and the body, cut to the bot's own outline so they sit right on all of them.
- **A feeling,** picked by the owner, and motion that means something: a bot works, waits, finishes, and sleeps where you can see it.
- **A new bot screen to match,** in the brand: quiet, black and white, with the bot as the only color on it.

Status: built on 2026-11-07, for 0.7.0, as planned the same day, from five rounds of design the owner chose from. Where the build differs, [What the build changed](#what-the-build-changed) says so. Researched against the research directive's references.

## What the owner asked

"I want to change our bot avatars up. Right now they are straight up clones of grokbot and I want to change that up a bit and also change up a bit of color/bot selection." Then, "we want them to feel like cute coworkers", thinking "flat and 3d, accessories, personality". Round 3 "doesn't fit our brand at all". Round 4 was "much better", though the things they wear "don't sit right on things or look cheap", and "our current avatars have a lot of emotion in their eyes and how they interact and follow". Of Round 5: "This looks much better, do this. Make sure the new bot experience lines up", and "works for our brand".

Round 5 is the design this builds: eyes, shapes, clothes, motion, and the picker.

## 0. Core or plugin

**Core.** A bot's look is part of the bot, stored on its row, and drawn wherever the app and plugins show one: the sidebar, the chat, rooms, pills, cards. There is nothing to add or leave out: a plugin can't change the row, and every bot has a look. `Blob` is already what plugins get for it, so this widens what's there. Plugins pass a whole bot to it, so what they show keeps up by itself.

The one addition to what plugins plug into is `waiting` on a profile, from the `{ wait }` a `tool.before` hook already answers.

## 1. Research

The owner named Muse, Duet, OpenAI's dots, and Grok Bot. Checked in the design rounds, and read again for this plan:

- **Grok Bot** ([docs](https://docs.x.ai/grok-bot/overview)) is what fxbot's look came from: flat color, a soft shape, two white eyes. Its users ask for states such as idle, thinking, working, waiting, and done, so a look that says what a bot is doing is wanted.
- **OpenAI's dots**, as press describes them: "a triangle with a bow tie, a bunny with headphones, a cloud with a beret". What a character wears carries its personality.
- **[OpenDots](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDots)** draws soft rendered bodies with stubby arms, and a small face set low. Rendered art is out of reach of hand-written vectors, and it's a picture, so it can't look at you.
- **[OpenMuse](https://github.com/CopilotKit/openmuse) and [OpenDuet](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenDuet)** use a capybara and a glowing orb. Nothing public shows the real products' designs, so they were hints and no more.
- **fxbot's brand** matters more than any of these. The product is black and white: Geist, hairline borders, generous space, and a logo of a black circle with two white pills. Its only color comes from bots, and plugin icons, which are soft gradients on pale tiles.
- **fxbot's avatars today.** Measured in Round 5: eyes a quarter of the body's height, at its center, with no mouth. All the feeling is in the eyes, and in how they follow, lean, blink, and hop. Round 4 cut the eyes to a quarter of that area and stopped the motion, and the owner felt it at once: "too small of facial features".

## 2. Key takeaways

- **The eyes are the character, and they're the logo.** Keep them big and central, the two pills, dark on soft color, with a small glint. Dark eyes on soft bodies is what stops this reading as Grok Bot. White pills on flat color is what it looks like now.
- **Color is the bot.** Everything on a bot is its own color or black and white. What it wears takes a deep shade of its own color by default: it reads as part of the character, and shows on a dark page, where black doesn't.
- **What's worn is cut to the body,** not laid on it. A hat that's drawn on top sits wrong on a heart. A hat that's the top of the body, painted, with a little overhang, fits anything.
- **Motion that means something.** A hop means working. A look says a bot is waiting. Motion costs battery, so it runs only when it says something.
- **Small sizes are drawn again,** like a good typeface: bolder eyes and no fine lines at 28 pixels and under.

## 3. Implementation

### A look

`shape` and `color` keep their names, so nothing about a bot changes by itself. Five columns join them, each with a default that draws nothing new, so a bot from before this phase keeps its shape and takes the new drawing of it.

| Field | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `shape` | The fourteen, then `mochi`, `gumdrop`, `toast`, `arch`, `pill`, `drop`, `peanut`, `puff`, `mushroom`, `bear`, `cat`, `mouse`, `bunny`, `frog`, `imp`, `bot`, `ghost`, `sprout` | `circle` |
| `color` | The same eleven | `brown` |
| `mood` | `bright`, `happy`, `calm`, `focus`, `doubt`, `wow`, `shy`, `wink` | `bright` |
| `head` | `none`, `headphones`, `beanie`, `cap`, `beret`, `headband`, `swoop` | `none` |
| `face` | `none`, `glasses`, `shades`, `mustache` | `none` |
| `outfit` | `none`, `blazer`, `turtleneck`, `hoodie`, `scarf`, `bowtie`, `badge` | `none` |
| `tint` | `own`, `black`, `white`: what they wear is dyed | `own` |

They're plain columns, as `shape` and `color` are, checked in `fields()` against lists in `types.ts`. Migration `0012_looks` adds them.

### Drawing

Two new files in `packages/ui/src`, both plain data and math with no React and no SDK import, so the site keeps a copy as it does for plugin icons:

- `blob-draw.ts`: the eyes, and what's worn. One eye is one outline from a few numbers, so a mood is only numbers, and any mood melts into any other. What's worn is measured from the shape's own outline.
- `blob-data.ts`, generated by `scripts/blob-data.mjs`: each shape's points, where its face sits, and each color's tones. A table replaces the math that builds fourteen shapes on every page load.

`Blob` draws its SVG from these as a string and sets it once, which is the same drawing for the app and the site's build. Every value in it comes from a list or a number: none of it is a bot's name or anything typed.

The Soft and Flat switch of Round 5 isn't built: Soft is the look, and small sizes are already redrawn.

### Motion

`blob.tsx` keeps the job it has, with one loop for every bot on the page:

| What's true | What the bot does |
|---|---|
| Nothing | Its feeling, a blink now and then, and a glance around, sometimes at another bot |
| `follow` | Its eyes and lean follow the pointer, and what it wears shifts a little less, so its head seems to turn |
| `busy` | Focused eyes, a hop, and a look around, as now |
| `waiting` | It looks at you and bobs |
| A turn just ended | Happy eyes for a few seconds |
| `provider` is empty | Asleep, since it can't answer, breathing slowly |
| Clicked | A squish and a smile |

The loop runs only while something moves. Between blinks it's one timer for the page, and a bot at rest writes nothing, so a page of idle bots costs about what it does today. The site's CSS blink and hop stay for the site. With reduced motion on, a bot holds still, with the face its state calls for.

`waiting` is true while a `tool.before` hook's `{ wait }` holds a call, counted in `wrap()` and read in `withBusy`. It covers a card waiting on the owner, and a reviewer model. The list is read again every 2 seconds while a bot is busy, so it costs no new request.

### The new bot screen

`LookPicker` moves to `look-picker.tsx`, with tabs for **Shape**, **Color**, **Feeling**, **Head**, **Face**, and **Body**, each option drawn on the owner's actual bot, and **Clothes** for the tint while a tab of things to wear is open. **Surprise me** picks a look. `BotForm` shows the bot large beside them on a wide screen, and above them on a phone, watching as you choose. The dialog widens to fit, and it's the same form in first-run setup and on a bot's edit page. Tokens only, so it holds in dark mode: the bot is the only color on the screen.

### Plugins

Plugins pass a whole bot, `<ui.Blob {...bot} size={20} />`, in chat rooms, messages, permissions, and pages, and bump a patch version. An older fxbot ignores what it doesn't know, so `minFxbot` stays. The `look` prop, which pointed the eyes in the old picker and was never in the docs, goes.

### The site

`packages/website/src/blob.tsx` draws from the copied files at build time. The home page's crowd becomes the team from Round 5.

### Cost

- **Page:** about 25 KB of shape points, 11 KB gzipped, in a bundle of 1.1 MB, less the geometry code it replaces. No new request or dependency, and no work at load to build shapes.
- **Message path:** nothing. `waiting` is two more lines in a list the app already reads.
- **Idle:** one timer, and a few frames for each blink.

### Not in this phase

- Rendered 3D. It would need an illustrator or an image model, and a picture can't follow you.
- Arms, feet, and things a bot carries.
- A bot choosing its own look.
- A `waiting` that tells a reviewer model from the owner.

Size: about 60 lines of SDK and migration, 330 of UI, 150 of generator, 40 of site, 15 in plugins, and 40 of docs. The generated table isn't counted.

## 4. Checklist

Checks use the harness the last phases used: a disposable Postgres, a check server on another port, the mock model, and Playwright at desktop and phone sizes. Writes to `/api/settings` are blocked on anything but a disposable database. Print a check's setup, and match exact fields: one that tested nothing can't pass.

**Bounded goals**
- **Size:** at most 700 hand-written lines, without the generated table and each plugin's `page.js`.
- **Out of scope:** [Not in this phase](#not-in-this-phase).
- **If it must be cut,** the site's crowd goes first, then the glance at other bots. The eyes, shapes, clothes, motion, and new bot screen stay.

**M1. The record**
- [x] A new install and an upgraded database both have the columns, and a bot from before keeps its shape and color, with the defaults.
- [x] Each field is saved, read back, and refused with 400 when it's not on its list.
- [x] `waiting` is true while a hook's `wait` holds a call, and false once it ends, or the turn stops.

**M2. The drawing**
- [x] Every shape, in every color, draws, and all 15 things to wear are looked at on all 32 shapes.
- [x] A saved bot from before this phase draws with no error, and an unknown value falls back and doesn't throw.
- [x] 16, 24, 40, 64, and 112 pixels hold up, in light and dark.

**M3. Motion**
- [x] Eyes follow the pointer where `follow` is on, and a bot leans.
- [x] Each row of the motion table works from its real signal: a real turn, a real card, a turn's end, a bot with no provider.
- [x] A page of idle bots asks for no frames between blinks.
- [x] Reduced motion holds still, and shows the state.

**M4. The new bot screen**
- [x] A bot made in the dialog keeps everything picked, and so does an edit.
- [x] First-run setup's bot step works, at desktop and phone sizes.
- [x] Tabs work from the keyboard, and each option has a name.
- [x] It holds at 390 pixels wide with no sideways scroll, and in dark mode.

**M5. Everywhere a bot shows**
- [x] The sidebar, the chat, library, plugin pages, and rooms show the whole look.
- [x] An older copy of a plugin, passing only `shape` and `color`, still draws.
- [x] The site builds, its crowd moves, and its links pass.

**M6. Wrap up**
- [x] `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run build-site` pass.
- [x] The full regression from the last phases still passes: 922 checks, none failed. It ran before **Change look** came in, which has 21 checks of its own.
- [x] Docs, changelog, and each plugin's version are updated, and this plan moves to `_completed`.

## 5. Open questions

Three were put to the owner with Round 5, and "do this" took Round 5 as it stood, so:
- **Soft or Flat:** Soft, the look it shipped in. Flat isn't built.
- **One thing to wear, or head, face, and body:** all three, as in the picker.
- **Black or the bot's own color for clothes:** its own color by default, and **Clothes** offers black and white.

## What the build changed

- **The record keeps a count in `index.ts`, not in the plugin host.** `withBusy` can run while plugins set up, before the host exists, so `held` sits beside `running`, and `createPlugins` gets `hold`.
- **A frog takes no hats.** Looking at all 15 things on all 32 shapes found its eyes, up in its bumps, go under any hat, so `hatless` in the table leaves it headphones, and the picker offers only what fits. The same look moved a scarf's tail and a name tag onto narrow bodies, and fitted a mustache to the chin.
- **A pumpkin keeps its stem,** which the design rounds had dropped, in a deep shade of its own color.
- **A bot awake doesn't breathe.** Round 5's idle breathing was too slight to see, and it would run frames all the time. A bot asleep breathes, in CSS. An idle page ran 33 frames in 8 seconds, of a possible 480.
- **A glance is for 32 pixels and up,** and the gaps between glances and blinks grow with the number of bots, so a long list stays quiet.
- **`Blob` gained `still`,** for a list of choices, and reads `provider` to sleep, so `{...bot}` is all a plugin passes.
- **A bot's edit page opens the picker in a dialog.** The plan put it on the page, which made the page very long with no clear way to save a look. **Change look** opens the same screen as a new bot, with **Save look**, and saves only the look, so what's half typed on the page stays. **Save** and **Delete** stay in view at the foot of the page.
- **The dialog is a fixed height,** so switching tabs doesn't move it, and has Round 5's **In your sidebar** row on a wide screen.
- **The `look` prop goes without a line in `plugin-breaks.json`.** It was never documented, nothing used it but the old picker, and a plugin that passes it still draws.
- **`colors` has new values** for the same names, each the middle of a bot's new body. A chat bubble keeps its own table, so messages look as they did.
- **Size:** 859 lines added and 414 removed, for 445 more, without the generated table, the site's copies, and each plugin's `page.js`. Added lines passed the plan's 700 because the generator moved 213 lines out of two copies of the geometry. The bundle grew by 40 KB, 10 KB of it gzipped shapes.
- **The edit page's bar clears the home indicator (before 0.7.0's release).** On an installed iPhone app, **Save** and **Delete** sat under it. The bar now pads its bottom by the safe area, as the message box does.
- **The body is its own outline (0.10.0, [#16](https://github.com/iammrduncan/fxbot/issues/16)).** It was a 140-unit square in the body's gradient, clipped to the outline. In Firefox 159 on Windows 11 with hardware acceleration, a bot leaning after the pointer showed thin lines along the right and bottom edges of its outline's bounding box: the square showing past the clip. The body is now the outline path, filled with the same gradient in user space (`x1` 1, `y1` -20, `x2` 99, `y2` 120, the square's own), and only the shine is clipped. All 32 shapes, upright and leaning 5° either way, at 24, 40, and 112 pixels, in Chromium and Firefox, differ from before only at single edge pixels. Headless Firefox here, which renders in software, never showed the lines, so the fix was checked against the issue's screenshot, not reproduced. What's worn still has its shadows clipped, and they cross the outline. If a dressed bot shows a short tick at its edge, they're next.
