---

What [`createFxbot`](/sdk/reference/create-fxbot/) resolves to: every call on bots, chats, providers, settings, the library, and plugins.

Every call returns a promise, unless its row says it is synchronous. A call that fails throws an `Error` with a `status`, as in [Errors](/sdk/reference/create-fxbot/#errors). A bot id is 12 hex characters: another shape fails with 400, and an unknown bot with 404.

## Bots

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profiles.list()` | Every bot: the pinned ones first, then the rest, each in the owner's order, and after it, in the order they were pinned, or by name. Each has `isDefault`, true for the bot a launch at `/` opens (Settings' `defaultProfile`). | `Profile[]` |
| `profiles.get(id)` | One bot | `Profile` |
| `profiles.create(fields)` | A new bot. Only `name` is required. `provider` defaults to Settings' `defaultProvider`. The first bot starts pinned. | `Profile` |
| `profiles.update(id, update)` | Changes any of the fields, and `pinned` | `Profile` |
| `profiles.order(ids)` | Sets the owner's order for the bots given, such as the sidebar's list after a drag. The others keep theirs, and ids it doesn't know change nothing. A bot that's pinned or unpinned goes to the end of its group. Since 0.7.0. | `Profile[]`, the whole list in its new order |
| `profiles.stop(id)` | Stops the turn running in the bot's own chat, whoever started it. A message it hadn't read runs next. Since 0.6.0. | nothing |
| `profiles.remove(id)` | Removes the bot, its messages, and its memories. Its library items stay, with `null` for the bot. Its libfx session stays in the database. | nothing |
| `profiles.earlier(id)` | The bot's chats before its current one, which a provider switch leaves behind, as finished turns, oldest first: the newest 400 messages of them. `Turn` is the client's type. | `Turn[]` |
| `profiles.skills(id)` | The skills the bot has, for a `$` and `/` picker, then the commands of the plugins on for it, with `command: true` | `BotSkill[]` |

The fields of a bot:

| Field | Rules | Default on create |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Trimmed, 1 to 200 characters | Required |
| `instructions` | Up to 64 KiB | `""` |
| `provider` | A provider id, or `""` for none. An unknown id fails with 404. | Settings' `defaultProvider` |
| `model` | Trimmed, up to 200 characters. `""` follows the provider's default model. | `""` |
| `effort` | How hard its model thinks: a level's name, such as `high`, letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`, up to 64 characters, or `""` for the model's own default. A level the model doesn't offer runs as the nearest lower one. Since 0.10.0. | `""` |
| `shape` | One of `shapes` | `circle` |
| `color` | A key of `colors` | `brown` |
| `mood` | One of `moods` | `bright` |
| `head` | One of `heads` | `none` |
| `face` | One of `faces` | `none` |
| `outfit` | One of `outfits` | `none` |
| `tint` | One of `tints`: what the bot wears is its `own` color, `black`, or `white` | `own` |

Other keys are ignored. An update also takes `pinned`:

- `pinned: true` fails with 400 when `maxPinned` (3) bots are pinned already.
- A new `provider` without a new `model` sets `model` to `""`.
- A new provider for a bot with a chat compacts the chat. The old provider summarizes it, or, when it can't, the new one summarizes the stored messages. The bot starts a new chat from that summary, its `handoff`, and the old chat moves to `earlier`. This fails with 400 when the old provider can't summarize and the new one has no model, and with 502 when neither provider could summarize.
- `provider: ""` fails with 400 for a bot with a chat.

### Memories

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `profiles.memories.list(id, { query?, limit? })` | The bot's memories, newest first. With `query`, the best matches, by words and, with an embedder, by meaning. `limit` is 1 to 500, default 200. | `Memory[]` |
| `profiles.memories.add(id, text)` | Adds a memory, saved by the owner. The text is trimmed, 1 to 1,000 characters. The same text again, ignoring case and extra spaces, returns the memory already there. | `Memory` |
| `profiles.memories.update(id, memoryId, text)` | New text for a memory. If another memory already says it, the two merge: this one is removed, and the other is returned. | `Memory` |
| `profiles.memories.remove(id, memoryId)` | Removes a memory | nothing |

`memoryId` is a memory's `id`, or `mem:<id>`. An unknown one fails with 404. See [Work with memories](/sdk/how-to/memories/).

## Chat

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `send(id, message)` | Sends a message to the bot. It resolves once libfx has stored the prompt. The reply arrives on the stream. | `{ messageId, sessionId }` |
| `stream(id, cursor = 0, session?)` | Every line of the bot's chat from `cursor` on, as NDJSON, then each new line. Cancel the stream to stop it. When the chat starts over, by a provider switch or a plugin's `startOver`, the stream ends with `{"type":"moved","sessionId":"<new>"}`. `session` is the session `cursor` is in: one the chat has moved from answers that line alone. | `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` |
| `streamEnd(id)` | The cursor of the newest line in the bot's chat, 0 for none. A stream opened after it replays up to that cursor, then follows. | `number` |

`send` takes a `Message`:

- `text` is required, unless the message has files.
- `messageId` is 1 to 128 letters, digits, `.`, `_`, or `-`. The same `messageId` again reaches the same turn and runs nothing new.
- `files` is up to 8 `{ name, type, data }`, with `data` in base64. An image is PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP, checked by its bytes: at most 3.75 MiB each, and 6 MiB for a message's images together. A PDF, since 0.10.0, is at most 8 MiB, and goes to the model as the text fxbot reads from it, page by page, up to 60,000 characters, with its `library:<id>` to read the rest. Any other file must be UTF-8 text with no NUL. It goes to the model as text, under its name. Every file is saved to the library, tagged with the bot and its chat.
- `$name` anywhere in the text, or `/name` at its start, names one of the bot's skills. That skill's instructions go with the message.
- It fails with 400 when the bot has no provider, or no model of its own and no default model on its provider.
- The first message starts the bot's chat and sets its `sessionId`.

`stream`:

- A line is one of libfx's stream lines. Its fields are the client's [`StreamLine`](/sdk/reference/client/#stream-lines).
- A `turn_start` for a message with files or skills carries the `input` and `files` that fxbot saved, which libfx's line lacks.
- `cursor` is a whole number, or the call fails with 400. 0 replays the whole chat. Each line's `cursor` is where to start again to get the lines after it.
- For a bot with no chat yet, or whose provider is gone, the stream ends at once.

See [Stream replies](/sdk/how-to/stream-replies/).

## Providers

A provider's `kind` is the `id` of its entry in fxbot's list of providers, `providers-registry.json`, which `providers.catalog()` answers. Every entry is in [Providers](/docs/reference/providers/).

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `providers.catalog()` | What there is to add: the list's entries this fxbot can run, models.dev's other OpenAI-compatible hosts in `more`, and whether fxbot runs in a container (`createFxbot`'s `machine` is set). A sign-in whose app isn't set is left out of its entry. The list is the one this release shipped with until `${listsUrl}/providers-registry.json` answers, and is read again every hour. | `Catalog` |
| `providers.local()` | The local servers in the list that answer at their usual address, each given half a second | `LocalServer[]` |
| `providers.list()` | Every provider, in the order they were added. `hasKey` and `signedIn` say whether it holds a key or a sign-in, not what it is. `label`, `connect`, and `docs` come from its entry. | `Provider[]` |
| `providers.add(input)` | A provider from an entry that takes a key, an address, or a service account. A key is checked with the provider first. | `Provider` |
| `providers.update(id, input)` | Changes `name`, `model`, `apiKey`, `serviceAccount` (Vertex AI), `modelIds`, `baseUrl` (a server's), `contextWindow` (a server's), or `teamId` (a Vercel account) | `Provider` |
| `providers.remove(id)` | Removes the provider. It fails with 400 while bots use it. When it was Settings' `defaultProvider` or `embeddingProvider`, that becomes `""`. | nothing |
| `providers.models(id)` | The provider's models, and what fxbot knows of each | `Model[]` |
| `providers.teams(id)` | A Vercel account's teams. Other kinds fail with 400. | `Team[]` |

`providers.add` takes a `NewProvider`:

- `kind` is an entry's `id`, from the list or from `more`. An entry that only signs in, such as `chatgpt`, fails here with 400.
- `fields` fill the entry's address, such as Bedrock's `{ region: "us-west-2" }`. A field with options takes one of them; any other takes a name of letters, digits, `.`, `_`, and `-`. A field left out takes its default.
- `baseUrl` is the entry's, with its fields, for a key. A server takes one, or uses its default, and `custom` needs one. It is `https`, or `http` on `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[::1]`, with no credentials, query, or fragment.
- `apiKey` is required for a key, optional for a server, and up to 4,096 characters. It is checked at the entry's `keyCheck`, or at the provider's `/models`, with the entry's headers. A status in the entry's `badKey`, 401 and 403 unless it says, fails with 400, "<Name> rejected this key (HTTP <status>): <why>." A 404 passes.
- `serviceAccount` is a service account's JSON key, as text, for `vertex`. Google must make a token from it, or it fails with 400.
- `modelIds` are model ids to list: an entry whose models are `typed`, such as Azure's deployments, needs at least one, and a server that lists models shows them after its own.
- `name` defaults to the entry's name. `model` is the default model for the provider's bots. `contextWindow` is for servers only: a whole number of tokens, or `null`. It overrides what the server reports.

`providers.update` fails with 400 for `apiKey` on a provider that signs in or takes a service account, and for `baseUrl` on one that isn't a server. A new key, address, team, service account, or model ids drops the kept model list.

### Sign-ins

A sign-in adds a provider from an entry with `signIn`: ChatGPT, Grok, Vercel, Hugging Face, and OrcaRouter by device code, and OpenRouter by PKCE. See [Connect providers](/sdk/how-to/providers/).

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `signIns.start({ kind, provider?, way? }, origin?)` | Starts a sign-in. With `provider`, it signs that provider in again. One runs at a time: a new one replaces one that waits. It fails with 502 when the service gives no code. OpenRouter's `way` is `redirect`, back to `${origin}/api/sign-ins/<id>/callback`, when `origin` is HTTPS or on localhost, and `paste` otherwise, or when `way` is `"paste"`. | `SignIn` |
| `signIns.get(id)` | Synchronous. The sign-in's status. It fails with 404 for a sign-in that isn't the latest one. When it is `done`, `provider` is the provider's id. | `SignInStatus` |
| `signIns.callback(id, query)` | Finishes a `redirect` sign-in with the `code` and `state` it came back with | `SignInStatus` |
| `signIns.code(id, code)` | Finishes OpenRouter's sign-in with the code its page showed | `SignInStatus` |
| `signIns.cancel(id)` | Synchronous. Stops a sign-in that waits. | nothing |

A new Vercel account with one team gets that team. Vercel's and Hugging Face's sign-ins need fxbot's own app at each: `createFxbot`'s `vercelClientId` and `hfClientId`, or the `clientId` the list names.

## Settings

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings.get()` | The settings | `Settings` |
| `settings.update(input)` | Changes any of the fields, and returns them all | `Settings` |
| `settings.embedding()` | How far memory search's vectors have got | `{ model, error, messages, withVectors, memories, memoriesWithVectors }` |

| Field | Type | Default | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `defaultProvider` | `string` | `""` | The provider new bots start on, or `""` for none |
| `timeZone` | `string` | `""` | The owner's time zone, such as `Europe/Berlin`, which plugins read. `""` is the machine's. Since 0.6.0. |
| `turnsAtOnce` | `number` | `32` | How many turns run at once, across every bot and chat, from 4 to 100. Read when fxbot starts. Since 0.6.0. |
| `defaultProfile` | `string` | `""` | The bot whose chat a launch at `/` opens, or `""` for none. A bot's id: an id of another shape fails with 400, and an unknown one with 404. Deleting the bot clears it. Since 0.5.0. |
| `onboarded` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether first-run setup is finished or skipped. Only `true` can be set. An install from before 0.7.0 with a bot, a plugin, or a provider starts `true`. Since 0.7.0. |
| `onboardingStep` | `string` | `""` | Where first-run setup is up to, so a reload or a restart comes back to it. Since 0.7.0. |
| `unvetted` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether plugins fxbot doesn't vet can be found and added: the public registries, and adding by address or repository |
| `embedder` | `"local"`, `"remote"`, or `"off"` | `"local"` | Where memory search's vectors come from: `embedUrl`, a provider's `/embeddings`, or none |
| `embeddingProvider` | `string` | `""` | For `remote`: a provider whose kind is in `embeddingKinds` |
| `embeddingModel` | `string` | `""` | For `remote`: the model's id, up to 200 characters |
| `messageVectors` | `number` | `8000` | How many characters of each message get a vector, 0 to 100,000. 0 embeds no messages. |

- `remote` needs both `embeddingProvider` and `embeddingModel`, or the update fails with 400.
- A new remote source embeds a test string first. If that fails, the update fails with 400, and the old settings stay.
- A change to memory search's fields starts filling in vectors again, in the background.

`settings.embedding()` gives the model in use, or `null` when vectors are off or the embedder doesn't answer, the fill-in's last `error`, and the counts. fxbot's server adds `local`, `switching`, and `canSwitch`, which make an `EmbeddingStatus`.

## Library

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `library.list(query)` | Items, newest saved first. `q` searches names and document text, and every word must match. `profileId` narrows to one bot, and `kind` to `image` or `document`. `limit` is 1 to 100, default 60. `before` is a page's `next`. Pass `{}` for all. | `LibraryPage` |
| `library.get(id)` | One item | `LibraryItem` |
| `library.file(id, ifNoneMatch?)` | The item's bytes as `data`, with its `name`, `kind`, `type`, and `sha256`. `data` is `null` when `ifNoneMatch` names the SHA-256 in quotes, as an ETag. | `{ name, kind, type, sha256, data }` |
| `library.upload(id, name, ifNoneMatch?)` | The same, for an image's address from before the library: a bot id, and `<sha256>.<ext>` with `png`, `jpg`, `gif`, or `webp` | `{ name, kind, type, sha256, data }` |
| `library.remove(id)` | Removes the one copy, for every bot it is tagged with | nothing |

An item's `url` is `/api/library/<id>/file`, a route of fxbot's server.

## Plugins

A plugin carries any mix of code, MCP servers, and skills. Each is one of three kinds of record: `mcp`, an MCP server; `skill`, one skill; and `package`, a folder with `plugin.json`, whose code, skills, and servers come with it. See [Give bots tools](/sdk/how-to/tools/), and for packages, [Plugin API](/sdk/reference/plugin-api/).

Until Settings' `unvetted` is true, search answers only from fxbot's own lists and asks no registry, and `preview` and `add` take only refs in those lists, failing with 400 for anything else.

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plugins.list()` | Every plugin. A server from a registry carries that entry's `info`, and a `mark` when it has a newer version, or is deprecated or gone. A skill or a package carries the `mark` of the hourly check. A package lists the servers it added in `servers`, and carries `unsupported`, saying why, when it can't run on this fxbot, since 0.7.0. A `mark` of `{ kind: "needs", version }` says a newer version needs that fxbot, since 0.7.0. Each plugin, and each card of a search, has `iconKey`, `creator/name`, which `pluginIcon` from `@fxbot/sdk/client` draws. A package on fxbot's list, and its card, carry `docs`, the path of its page in fxbot's docs on fxbot.sh, when the list has one, since 0.9.0. | `Plugin[]` |
| `plugins.search(q, options)` | Up to 20 servers from fxbot's list and the mirror of GitHub's registry. `{ everything: true }` adds the official registry's results, for 3 characters or more. `{ kind: "skill" }` searches skills instead: fxbot's list, then skills.sh for 2 characters or more. `options` is required: pass `{}` for servers. | `McpSearch` or `SkillSearch` |
| `plugins.preview(ref)` | A plugin's page, with a `hash`. For a server, what probing it found. For a skill or a package, its files at its repository's current commit. A package that can't run on this fxbot has `unfit`, and `needsFxbot` when a newer fxbot would run it, since 0.7.0. | `McpPreview`, `SkillPreview`, or `PackagePreview` |
| `plugins.add(ref, hash)` | Adds what the preview showed. It fails with 409 when that changed since, or the skill is already added. | `Plugin` |
| `plugins.update(id, hash)` | Moves a registry server or a skill to the newer definition its page showed. It fails with 409 when that changed since. | `Plugin` |
| `plugins.change(id, input)` | Sets `enabled`, `bots` (`"all"`, or `"each"` for chosen bots), and for a server, `allowed`: the names of the tools bots get. A package's servers follow its `enabled` and `bots`. | `Plugin` |
| `plugins.remove(id)` | Removes the plugin | nothing |
| `plugins.setSecrets(id, secrets)` | A server's header values, or the owner's own OAuth `clientId` and `clientSecret`. Write-only. | `Plugin` |
| `plugins.forBot(profileId, pluginId, enabled)` | Turns a plugin on or off for one bot. It counts when the plugin's `bots` is `"each"`, and a package's servers follow. | `Plugin` |
| `plugins.readSkill(id, file?)` | Synchronous. One of an installed skill's files, `SKILL.md` by default. | `string` |
| `plugins.check()` | Runs the hourly check of the skills' and packages' repositories now | nothing |
| `plugins.wontRun(next)` | The running packages from GitHub that wouldn't run on fxbot `next`, by name, from their `minFxbot` and what that release broke. Since 0.7.0. | `Promise<string[]>` |
| `plugins.configure(id, settings)` | A package's settings: a value for each one named, or `""` for its default. Secrets are write-only. | `PackagePlugin` |
| `plugins.log(id)` | Synchronous. A package's recent log lines and errors | `string[]` |
| `plugins.contents(id)` | An installed package's page, read from the files it runs: its commit's for one from GitHub, its folder for a local one, whose `source` is `{ local }`. It throws 404 for an id that isn't a package. Since 0.5.0. | `PackagePreview` |
| `plugins.pages()` | The running packages' page code and CSS, by URL, for the page | `PluginPage[]` |
| `plugins.file(name, path)` | A running package's page code or CSS, and nothing else of its files. `pinned` says its URL names a commit. | `{ type, data, pinned }` |
| `plugins.handle(name, request, path)` | Answers a request to `/api/plugins/<name>/<path>` with the package's route | `Response` |

`createFxbot` takes `pluginDirs`: package folders that load at start, for writing a package.

A `PluginRef` is one of:

| Ref | What it names |
| --- | --- |
| `{ url, transport?, headers?, allowLocal? }` | A server by its address. `transport` is `streamable-http` (default) or `sse`. `headers` names the headers it needs. The address is `https`. A local or private address needs `allowLocal`, and may then use `http`. |
| `{ registry, version?, allowLocal?, from? }` | A registry entry, from `github` (default), `fxbot`, or `official` |
| `{ skill, from? }` | A skill, as `<owner>/<repo>/<skillId>` |
| `{ repo, from? }` | A package, as `<owner>/<repo>` or `<owner>/<repo>/<folder>`, from `github` (default) or `fxbot` |

A server's `allowed` starts as its read-only tools. A header value is one line, up to 8 KiB, for a header the server was added with.

### OAuth

`oauth` signs in to a server whose `auth` is `oauth`.

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oauth.start(id, origin?)` | Starts a sign-in, which expires in 10 minutes. With `mode: "redirect"`, the browser comes back to `<origin>/api/oauth/callback`, for an HTTPS `origin`. With `mode: "paste"`, it comes back to `<localUrl>/callback`, and the person pastes that address when the page doesn't load. A new sign-in to the same server replaces one that waits. | `OAuthAttempt` |
| `oauth.get(attemptId)` | Synchronous. The sign-in's status. | `OAuthStatus` |
| `oauth.paste(attemptId, address)` | Finishes a sign-in with the address the person pasted | `OAuthStatus` |
| `oauth.callback(query)` | Finishes a redirect, from its query string as `URLSearchParams` | `OAuthStatus` |

`origin` is the page's origin, which the server has checked against its own host.

## Release and close

| Call | What it does | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `release()` | Synchronous. The running `version`, and `latest`, the newest stable release when it is newer, or `null` | `{ version, latest }` |
| `close()` | Closes the agents, which waits for their running turns, and waits for their replies to be saved, then stops the plugins, the timers, and the MCP connections, and ends the Postgres connection. See [Stopping](/sdk/reference/create-fxbot/#stopping). | nothing |

## Tools every bot gets

Every agent has these tools. Each one acts for the bot whose chat runs it.

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `chat_history` | Searches the bot's history in all of its chats: messages, thinking, and tool calls with their results, since 0.6.0, by words, and messages by meaning too when message vectors are on. With `around`, a `msg:<id>`, it reads that message and up to 6 on each side, in full. |
| `memory_save` | Saves one fact, up to 1,000 characters. With `replaces`, a `mem:<id>`, it changes that memory instead. |
| `memory_search` | Searches the bot's memories by words and, with an embedder, by meaning: up to 20 |
| `memory_forget` | Removes a memory by its `mem:<id>` |
| `library_search` | Searches the items tagged with the bot, by name and document text. An empty query lists the newest. |
| `library_read` | Opens a `library:<id>`: a document's text, up to 60,000 bytes, or an image. A PDF is its text. Since 0.10.0, `from` reads on from a character |
| `library_save` | Saves a document the bot wrote. The name ends in `.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`, or `.json`, and the text is up to 1 MiB. |
| `skill` | Present while a skill is on. Loads a skill by `name`, one of its files by `file`, in parts of 60 KB, or finds skills by `search`. |
| `<prefix>_<tool>` | Each enabled MCP server's allowed tools. The prefix comes from the server's name or host, such as `linear` for `mcp.linear.app`, and is unique among plugins. For a server set to `each`, a call from a bot it isn't on for fails. |

A bot's instructions on each turn are its own, then its `handoff`, its newest memories in up to 2% of the model's context window, and the list of its skills in up to 1%.

## Exports

From `@fxbot/sdk`, besides `createFxbot`:

| Export | Returns | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `readKey(text)` | `Buffer` | Decodes the key file's base64 text. It throws unless the key is 32 bytes. |
| `rotateSecrets({ databaseUrl, from, to })` | `number` | Seals every stored secret again, providers' and plugins', from the key `from` to the key `to`, in one transaction, on a connection of its own. Run it with the server stopped. It returns how many it sealed. |
| `compareVersions(a, b)` | `number` | Below zero when `a` is older than `b`. A prerelease comes before its release. It throws for a string that isn't a version. |
| `isVersion(version)` | `boolean` | Whether it is `x.y.z`, with an optional `v` before it and an optional prerelease after a dash, such as `0.4.0-rc.1` |
| `isStable(version)` | `boolean` | Whether it is a version with no prerelease |
| `releasesUrlFor(repository)` | `string` or `undefined` | GitHub's `releases/latest` API address for a `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URL |

| Table | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `moods`, `heads`, `faces`, `outfits`, `tints` | What a bot can feel and wear, by name |
| `colors` | A bot's colors, from name to hex: `black`, `brown`, `red`, `orange`, `amber`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `purple`, `pink`, `gray` |
| `shapes` | A bot's shapes: `circle`, `cloud`, `squircle`, `star`, `clover`, `heart`, `flower`, `egg`, `bean`, `triangle`, `diamond`, `sparkle`, `hexagon`, `pumpkin`, `mochi`, `gumdrop`, `toast`, `arch`, `pill`, `drop`, `peanut`, `puff`, `mushroom`, `bear`, `cat`, `mouse`, `bunny`, `frog`, `imp`, `bot`, `ghost`, `sprout` |
| `kinds` | The eleven kinds fxbot has had since 0.2.0, each with its `label`, `connect` (`device`, `key`, or `url`), and `baseUrl` where it is fixed or a default. Every provider there is to add is in `providers.catalog()`. |
| `itemKinds` | `image`, `document` |
| `embeddingKinds` | The provider kinds that serve `/embeddings`: `openai`, `openrouter`, `gateway`, `vercel`, `ollama`, `lmstudio`, `custom` |
| `maxPinned` | 3 |

Every type the calls take or return is exported too, with `FxbotOptions` and `Fxbot`, the type of this object. `Turn` and `Part` come from `@fxbot/sdk/client`.

## Types

```ts
type Fields = { name: string; instructions: string; model: string; provider: string; effort: string; shape: Shape; color: Color; mood: Mood; head: Head; face: Face; outfit: Outfit; tint: Tint };

type Profile = Fields & {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string | null; // the current chat, from the first message
  preview: string | null; // the start of the latest reply
