fxbot is built for one person's machine. It keeps every secret on the server, sealed, and leaves who reaches it to you. This page is about why it works that way, and where its edges are.

## Loopback only, with no login

fxbot listens on the machine's 127.0.0.1 and has no accounts, so what sits in front of it decides who gets in. On the machine itself, that is whoever uses that machine. Through web pairing, the recommended way in, it is the devices you've paired, each with a key of its own that you approved. Through Tailscale, it is your tailnet's access rules. Either way, each device is already known, so a second login in fxbot would be one more password guarding the same door, and a weaker one.

The cost is that whoever reaches the address can use all of fxbot: every bot, every chat, every provider. So fxbot should never be open to a network directly, through port forwarding or [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel), and any other way in, such as a reverse proxy, needs a login of its own ([Reach it from other devices](/docs/how-to/reach-it/)).

In a release install, fxbot runs in a container as the `fxbot` user, and compose publishes its port on the machine's 127.0.0.1. Its database has no port on the machine.

## Keys sealed in Postgres

Every key and token fxbot stores is sealed in the SDK with AES-256-GCM before it reaches Postgres, with a fresh nonce each time, and bound to the record it belongs to. Postgres holds only ciphertext and never sees the key. fxbot doesn't use pgcrypto, whose key would travel inside SQL and could reach Postgres's logs.

The key is a file, `/etc/fxbot/secret.key` in a release install, that only the server's user reads. Compose mounts it into the app's container, read-only.

`sudo fxbot rotate-key` seals everything again under a new key, for when the old one may have leaked; a checkout uses `npm run rotate-key`. See [Commands](/docs/reference/commands/#fxbot-rotate-key).

## Nothing secret on the page

The page sends a key, or Vertex AI's service account file, once, and never gets it back: a provider in a list says only whether it has a key or a sign-in. Device code and OAuth sign-ins run on the server, as attempts the page checks on. The page sees a link and a code, and never a verifier or a token. OpenRouter's sign-in comes back to fxbot's own address, where the server trades the code for a key with a verifier only it holds.

The page's code carries no credentials, and its build reads no `.env`.

## Files served as data

The library serves what chats hold as data, never as a page. Images are checked from their bytes. Documents are served as plain text, with `nosniff` and a sandbox that runs nothing, even opened in a tab of their own. The library never serves HTML or SVG as themselves. The Pages plugin runs a bot's HTML page in a sandboxed frame of its own, as [Keep what a bot writes](/docs/how-to/keep-what-a-bot-writes/) describes.

## Vetted plugins

By default, fxbot finds and adds only the plugins on its own lists, which the project vets, tagged **fxbot**. Until you turn on **Show unvetted plugins** in **Settings** › **Plugins**, fxbot asks none of the public registries, and its server refuses to look at or add anything else: an MCP server by its address, a public registry's entry, a skill from skills.sh, or a repository. Plugins you already added keep working either way. Vetting is the project's choice of what to list, not a review of every version that follows.

## MCP servers

A remote MCP server's tools are code fxbot doesn't control, and a call may not be safe to run twice. Bots get only a server's read-only tools until you allow others by name. The [permissions](/docs/how-to/choose-what-a-bot-can-do-alone/) plugin can ask before any tool call, a server's included.

Adding a server makes fxbot's server fetch its address. So fxbot takes HTTPS only, and refuses local and private addresses, the tailnet's included, unless you allow one for a server you run. A server's key, headers, and OAuth client are sealed like a provider's.

A registry entry says who published it, checked by the registry, but not that its server is safe or theirs. Its page shows the server's host, in red when it isn't on the publisher's domain, and nothing is saved before **Add**. If the entry changes between the page and **Add**, fxbot refuses and shows the page again. fxbot fetches its own lists every hour, GitHub's MCP registry every hour while unvetted plugins are on or a server from it is installed, and the official registry only when you tick **Search everything**, which sends it your search words. It loads no icons from them.

## Skills

A skill is someone else's instructions, which a bot follows like its own. fxbot shows a skill's `SKILL.md` before you add it, and keeps it pinned to the commit of its repository that page came from. When its files change there, it waits for you to update it. Nothing in a skill runs: fxbot keeps only its text files, and bots read its scripts as text. With unvetted plugins on, each search sends its words to skills.sh, and adding a skill fetches its repository from GitHub.

## Plugins with code

A plugin with code runs inside fxbot, with everything fxbot can reach: its database, the keys it opens, every bot's chats, and in a release, whatever fxbot's container reaches. Adding one trusts its author as much as fxbot's own. So fxbot shows its code before you add it, keeps it pinned to the commit of its repository that page came from, and waits for you when its files change there, showing what changed. Only the page code and CSS that its `plugin.json` names are served to the page. Its secret settings are sealed like a provider's key, and the page never gets them back.

## What it doesn't cover

- Each message goes to the provider its bot uses, which sees the chat. Only a local model server keeps it on your network. With a provider's embedding model for memory search, that provider also receives the text of every memory and message it turns into a vector.
- There are no users, roles, or audit log inside fxbot.
- The backups taken before migrations hold the database and the data folder, readable only by `fxbot`. The secrets in them stay sealed.
