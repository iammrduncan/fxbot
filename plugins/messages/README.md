# messages

A plugin for [fxbot](https://fxbot.sh): the owner's bots message each other in their own chats, so one can ask another for what it knows, or hand it a job, and the owner sees the work where it happens.

Add it from **Plugins**, where fxbot's list has it. It runs inside fxbot: read its code there before you add it. It needs fxbot 0.6.0 or newer. See [Let bots work together](https://fxbot.sh/docs/how-to/let-bots-work-together/).

Its skill, `messages`, says when to message another bot, how to write a message it can act on, how replies go, and what to do when one reaches you.

## A message

- **Sending:** a bot calls `messages_send` with `to`, `text`, and optionally `reply: false` and `files`. Who it's from, its conversation, and what it answers come from the call and the rows, never from the model.
- **Where it goes:** the receiver's own chat, in a pill that opens to "From Bob" with the sender's words. A working bot takes it in where it is, through core's steering, and an idle one wakes. A message with an image waits for the running turn, since joining would end it, and so does a message to a turn that takes none.
- **What the model gets:** a frame that opens by saying this isn't from the owner, with the words quoted, what the sender can't OK, and whether a reply is expected. libfx labels every steer as the user's, so the frame is what says otherwise. When libfx lets a steer name its author, core passes it.
- **What the owner asked:** when the owner's own words began the conversation, what started that turn and what they added while it ran, up to 2,000 characters, every bot it reaches but the one they were said to gets them in its frame, quoted from that bot's chat, not from the sender's message, before the sender's words. It says when they name the bot. The message passes them to core as `asked`, for a reviewer such as the permissions plugin's, on fxbot 0.7.0 or newer.
- **Who a bot can reach:** the others the plugin is on for, named in its instructions, each with its line from **Messages** in its settings. Any can reach any: the plugin's switch for each bot is how an owner narrows it.

## In a chat

Messages between bots fold into a pill in the middle of the chat, with each bot's face, such as **2 received, 1 sent · Philly**, through `app.fold`. A send that went counts as sent, and its card goes in the pill. One that was refused stays a card, in view. A run of them makes one pill, until the owner or the bot says something to the other, and a click opens it. A message that expects a reply folds with its turn, since that turn's answer goes to the other bot: its id is `messages-ask-<row>-<sender>`. After any other, `messages-in-<row>-<sender>`, what the bot says is for the owner, so it stays in view. The sender's id is what picks the face, so two of one name aren't confused. A turn the owner wrote into stays in view too.

## Tags

This plugin replaces the message box in a bot's chat with an editor, as a room's is. `@` at the start of a line or after a space lists the bots it can reach, each with its line, or its id if it has none. The one you pick is a chip with its face, in the sentence, which deletes as one piece. It's sent as a link, `[@Name](/profiles/<id>)`, so the bot knows exactly which one you mean, even with two of one name, and it shows as a chip in the message too. A name you type out stays plain text.

A tag names a bot, and wakes no one. The bot you're talking to does the sending, with `messages_send`, and everything here applies to it. `to` takes the whole tag, as well as a name or an id.

## Replies

A message's `reply` is `yes`, `no`, or `maybe`. A send to the bot whose message reached this turn is a reply: the plugin sets `answers` to that message, and `answered_at` on it.

When a turn a `yes` message started ends:

| How it ended | What the asker gets |
| --- | --- |
| It failed, or the owner stopped it | A note, with no reply needed |
| Its last act was a send to the asker | Nothing more |
| Its last message is empty, `(no reply)`, or libfx's `Done.` | A note: it finished without an answer |
| Otherwise | Its last message, as a `maybe`, with what the turn saved |

A `yes` message that joined a turn and stayed unanswered gets one turn of its own, `messages-again-<id>`, since that turn's last message is for someone else. A turn a `no` message reached can't message that sender. Every note is `no`, so notes don't chain.

## Limits

- **A conversation** starts when a turn no message started sends one, follows the work across bots, and stops at `conversation` messages, or at the owner's **Stop**. The count and the write are one step, under a lock, so parallel sends can't pass it. What the server sends counts too: at the budget, a last message isn't sent, and the log says so.
- **A turn** sends at most `perTurn`, raised before anything waits.
- **Two bots** send at most `perHour` between them.
- **A repeat** is one message: its key is a hash of the turn, the receiver, and the words. A call cut off by a crash runs again and lands on its row.
- **A turn a message started** stops at `minutes` and `calls`. A turn it only joined keeps whatever limits it had.

Nothing is retried. A turn has effects, and a bot can ask again.

## The screen

**Open conversations**, on the plugin's tab in **Settings**, opens `/messages`, which shows each conversation as one thread, newest first, with its count, each message's state, **Stop** while one runs, and **Older**. It reads again every 5 seconds while a message is out. A row opens that bot's chat. **Stop** marks the conversation, cancels the turns its messages started, and cancels a waiting one when it starts. The sender hears nothing, and a turn a message only joined goes on.

A send shows in the sender's reply as a card: who it's to, the words, and how it went.

## Settings

| Setting | What it is | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation` | The most messages in one conversation, 1 to 100 | `20` |
| `perTurn` | The most messages one turn sends, 1 to 20 | `5` |
| `perHour` | The most messages between two bots in an hour, 1 to 1,000 | `60` |
| `minutes` | The most minutes a bot works on one message, 1 to 240 | `15` |
| `calls` | The most tool calls in one message's turn, 1 to 1,000 | `100` |

A value outside its range means its default, with a line in the plugin's log.

## Tables

In the plugin's own schema, `plugin_messages`, from `fxbot/migrations/`:
- `conversations`: each thread, by the turn that began it, the owner's words that began it, and when it was stopped
- `messages`: each message, its words, who it's from and to, what it answers, the turn it started or joined, and how it went
- `roles`: what each bot does, for the others

Each send deletes conversations older than 30 days. Removing the plugin drops the schema. What was said stays in the chats.

## Cost

- **Each message of any bot:** one in-memory check per tool call. Every request of every bot carries the tool's definition, about 130 tokens, cached with the rest. A bot it's on for carries the skill's line in its list of skills, about 60 tokens, and about 700 when it reads the skill. Plugin tools join every agent, so a bot the plugin is off for carries it too.
- **Each chat that opens:** one read of the bots and their lines, and one short entry in its instructions.
- **Idle:** nothing, but a timer for each message working.
- **A message to an idle bot:** one turn at its whole chat, cached where the provider caches. This is the cost to watch: a conversation of 20 messages is at most 20 turns.
- **A message to a working bot:** no new turn.
- **Storage:** 30 days of rows. The turns are in the chats, so a message adds no session.
- **The page:** `page.js` is about 370 KB, most of it ProseMirror, which a plugin bundles for itself.

## Files

| File | What it is |

| `plugin.json` | Its name, its parts, and its settings |
| `fxbot/server.ts` | The tool and its guards, delivery, the reply rule, limits, and the routes |
| `fxbot/migrations/0001_messages.sql` | Its three tables |
| `fxbot/migrations/0002_asked.sql` | The owner's words on a conversation |
| `fxbot/page.jsx` | The Messages screen, the card in a reply, the line in a bot's settings, and a tag in a sent message |
| `fxbot/box.jsx` | The message box, with `@` and its chips |
| `fxbot/page.css` | The box's styles, and the rules ProseMirror needs |
| `fxbot/page.js` | `page.jsx` and `box.jsx`, built |
| `skills/messages/SKILL.md` | Its skill |
| `fxbot/page-licenses.txt` | The licenses of what `page.js` bundles |
| `package.json` | `"type": "module"`, for the server code, and what the page is built from |

Build `page.js` from this folder with these. It's built without comments, since ProseMirror's are long. When the bundled packages change, write `fxbot/page-licenses.txt` again from their `LICENSE` files.

```sh
npm install
npx rolldown fxbot/page.jsx --format cjs -e react -e react/jsx-runtime -e @fxbot/app --no-comments --file fxbot/page.js
