# Conventions

Simplicity over complexity, small over huge, light over heavy, and performance over other things. A smaller solution that does the job beats a rule carried over from an older design.

## Core or plugin

fxbot is a small core that every install runs, and plugins that each owner adds if they want them. Like [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), "a minimal, extensible agent harness", the core stays small so that plugins can make fxbot what each owner wants. Before building a feature, ask: is this core, or a plugin? The default answer is plugin. Say which in the feature's phase doc, and why.

A feature is core only when it is one of these:
- **What every bot needs:** a model, its instructions, a chat that lasts, its files, its memory, and context that fits the model.
- **What plugins plug into:** what a plugin can carry (code, MCP servers, and skills), finding, vetting, adding, and updating plugins, and the plugin API.
- **What fxbot needs to run:** install, updates, migrations, and sealed secrets.

Everything else is a plugin. A knowledge graph, chat rooms, web search, a password manager, and herdr are plugins.

Plugins are real extensions of the app, not features bolted on beside it. The plugin API ([plugins](docs/_completed/phases/plugins.md), built in 0.4.0) lets a plugin change core behavior as well as add its own:
- hook into a bot's turns and tool calls: change a message before it runs, a bot's instructions, or a tool's input or result, or block a call
- add tools, server routes, and data of its own
- add to the app: a screen, a sidebar entry, a button in the message box, a way to show a message, or a panel in Settings
- start a bot's turn, for a schedule, an event, or another bot

The rules:
- When a plugin can't do what it needs, widen the plugin API with the smallest hook or place in the app that it needs. Don't build the feature in core. Add a hook when a real plugin needs it, not before.
- Build core features so plugins can change them: core behavior runs through the same hooks plugins get.
- A plugin that isn't added costs nothing: no process, no timer, no request, no table, no code in the page, and no space in the app.
- A plugin's data lives in its own tables or files, which it creates and removes. Never in a core migration.
- The core never imports or names a particular plugin. fxbot's lists name the plugins it suggests, as data.
- fxbot's own plugins use the same plugin API as anyone's. If one needs a shortcut into core, the API is missing a hook.
- Removing a plugin leaves the core working.
- A change that removes or breaks something in the plugin API adds a line to `packages/sdk/src/plugin-breaks.json`, and a note under `## Unreleased`. A plugin that starts using something newer raises its `minFxbot`.

## Bots and the owner's machine

A bot never acts on the owner's machine directly: it reads, writes, and removes no file outside fxbot's own data, and runs no command there. Its tools work on fxbot's own data, the library, memories, and skills, and on services it reaches over the network. Work that needs files or commands happens on the [computer](docs/_completed/phases/computer.md), a machine of each bot's own, apart from the owner's. This is what lets fxbot run as an app on the owner's own computer, outside a VM.
- A plugin's tools follow the same rule. A tool that reaches the machine, a folder or a command on it, belongs only in the [local access](docs/phases/plugin-local-access.md) plugin, which the owner adds and turns on, folder by folder. It's never on by default, and never in **Essentials**.
- MCP servers are reached over the network. One on this machine, or on the owner's own network, is the owner's to allow, server by server, as today.
- libfx turns on none of fx's own shell or file tools, and fxbot doesn't either.
- The rule is about what bots do through tools. A plugin's own code runs in fxbot's process, as the owner installed it.

## Code

- Keep files small and on one job. Split a file when it is hard to read in one sitting.
- Prefer few dependencies. Each one needs a reason. Use Node and the browser before adding a package.
- Keep what every owner waits on fast: loading the page, sending a message, and streaming a reply. Say what a change adds to those in requests, work, or page weight.
- Do not add an abstraction before a second real use. A few duplicated lines are fine.
- Write plain TypeScript. Skip classes, generic frameworks, and wrappers unless a library requires them.
- Delete unused code before adding more. Do not leave speculative hooks, options, or empty layers.
- Name things for what they are. Comment only where the next reader would otherwise guess wrong.
- Check outside input at the edge that receives it. One check is enough.
- Test behavior that can break, against disposable data. Skip a new test harness for a one-line change.
- Stay four packages (sdk, server, ui, and website, the public site), one fxbot server process, and Postgres until a real limit says otherwise. A new package needs a second real consumer.
- Keep records in Postgres, one statement or one transaction per change, so concurrent requests never interleave a read-modify-write. Store calls are async.
- Never store a secret in plain text: seal it in the SDK, so Postgres holds only ciphertext.
